### In 2010, I was recruited to TSMC’s Fab 15, where I was responsible for the critical HK/MG process technology during the 28nm competition with Samsung Electronics. Currently, I am engaged in self-built housing and land development projects, further broadening my business scope.

###  In the future, I aspire to leverage the learning and resources from NYCU to pursue a dual master's degree at Fordham University. Through academic research, I aim to explore passive income opportunities and discover an efficient way to “earn while lying down,” integrating my interests with business development to create a more diverse and sustainable future.
